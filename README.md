Hello! That's my own small "framework".
I want to use only those technologies that make me excited about them.
That means that list of those technologies could change over time.

Actual list of my favorites:

* Technologies for application:
  * [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) is best solution to write
    truly flexible backend API.
  * [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux) is managing local state of client
    application in functional way. Its way allows you forget about problems of
    state mutations and gives you many powerful abilities like time traveling.
  * [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com) is very useful database for data that are weaves
    like a spider web. At first, its query language seems strange, but after
    a while comes the realization of all its power.
  * [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) component library impressively
    reduces complexity of UI. For me it's not about speed, it's about clearly
    defined interfaces of all components.
  * [React Router](http://rackt.github.io/react-router/) is good for
    applications with any sizes. At least after they're reached version 1.0.
  * [Fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org) is promise-based HTTP client. I'm
    using [whatwg-fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch) for browser and
    [node-fetch](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch) for node.
  * [Strulidator](https://github.com/vslinko/strulidator) is my view on how
    should looks validator of complex nested structures.
  * [Express](http://expressjs.com) is popular library to write HTTP servers
    without pain. All my HTTP servers are pretty simple so express fits for all
    my needs.
* Technologies for application development:
  * [Babel](http://babeljs.io). I love all the new features of ECMAScript!
    And babel allows me to use those features right now.
  * [ESLint](http://eslint.org) keeps my internal perfectionist in comfort.
  * [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) is very powerful tool that helps me
    build first-grade releases. Finest tool at current time but not simplest.
  * [Forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever) is used to restart backend
    server when code is changed by developer. Hot reload everywhere!
  * [WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io) is a test runner based on Selenium API.
    Easiest way to write E2E tests.
  * [Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) is solution for
    acceptance and integration tests. It's using native language to describe
    application behavior.
  * [selenium-standalone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-standalone) -
    CLI wrapper on Selenium. Just run `selenium-standalone install` and
    `selenium-standalone start` to get your Selenium.
  * [Chai](http://chaijs.com) is assertion library for all kinds of tests.

I believe that best Developer Experience leads us to best User Experience.
